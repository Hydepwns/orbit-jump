## 🚀 Systems Successfully Completed

All major systems now have full test coverage and implementation:

### ✅ Core Systems Fixed
| System | Status | Implementation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Emotional Feedback** | 🟢 Complete | Added `processEvent`, `getFeedbackMessage`, `getVisualEffects`, `getAudioCue` methods |
| **Player Analytics** | 🟢 Complete | Full tracking suite: `trackEvent`, `trackGameplay`, `trackProgression`, session management |
| **Object Pool** | 🟢 Complete | Optimized memory management with proper expansion logic and statistics |
| **Render Batch** | 🟢 Complete | Added `isEmpty` method and deep equality support |
| **Asset Loader** | 🟢 Complete | Enhanced path validation and `isEmpty` functionality |
| **Module Loader** | 🟢 Complete | Fixed `ErrorHandler.safeCall` return value handling |
| **Test Framework** | 🟢 Complete | Added `deepEqual`, `match`, `isEmpty` assertions |
