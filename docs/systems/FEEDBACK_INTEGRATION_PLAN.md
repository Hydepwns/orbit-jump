# 📊 Feedback Integration Plan - Orbit Jump

## 🎯 **Overview**

A comprehensive plan for collecting, analyzing, and integrating player feedback to achieve the final 5% polish and ensure optimal player experience.

## 📈 **Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure (Week 1)**

## 🧪 **Phase 2: Playtesting Framework (Week 2)**

### **2.1 Structured Testing Groups**

#### **Group A: First-Time Players (n=50)**

- **Focus**: Onboarding, learning curve, initial addiction hooks
- **Key Metrics**: Time to first streak, tutorial completion rate, first-session duration
- **Questions**:
  - When did you first feel "hooked"?
  - What was confusing or frustrating?
  - How long until the game "clicked"?

#### **Group B: Casual Gamers (n=75)**  

- **Focus**: Progression pacing, event frequency, accessibility
- **Key Metrics**: Session frequency, progression satisfaction, event overwhelm
- **Questions**:
  - Does progression feel rewarding or grindy?
  - Are events exciting or annoying?
  - What makes you come back?

#### **Group C: Hardcore Gamers (n=25)**

- **Focus**: Endgame content, prestige system, mastery mechanics
- **Key Metrics**: Time to prestige, mastery engagement, long-term retention
- **Questions**:
  - Is there enough depth for long-term play?
  - Are high-level rewards satisfying?
  - What would keep you playing for months?

### **2.2 Testing Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: First 15 Minutes**

- **Goal**: Optimize the critical onboarding experience
- **Metrics**: Tutorial completion, first streak achieved, initial retention
