# ADR-001: Use Facade Pattern for Complex Systems

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Orbit Jump codebase contains several complex systems (player, warp drive, emotional feedback) that were becoming monolithic and difficult to maintain. Files were growing to 400+ lines with mixed responsibilities.

## Decision
We will use the Facade pattern for all complex systems, where:
- A main facade file provides the public API
- Internal complexity is delegated to focused submodules
- Each submodule has a single responsibility

Example structure:
```
src/systems/
├── player_system.lua          (facade)
└── player/
    ├── player_movement.lua    (physics)
    ├── player_abilities.lua   (jump/dash)
    ├── player_state.lua       (state management)
    └── player_rendering.lua   (visuals)
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved code organization and readability
- Easier to test individual components
- Reduced merge conflicts in team development
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to find and fix bugs

### Negative
- More files to navigate
- Slight overhead in facade delegation
- Need to maintain consistent interfaces

### Neutral
- Requires team agreement on module boundaries
- Learning curve for new developers

## Implementation
1. Identify systems > 300 lines
2. Extract cohesive functionality into submodules
3. Create facade that delegates to submodules
4. Maintain backward compatibility during migration
