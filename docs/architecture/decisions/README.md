# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Orbit Jump project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive
- Benefits gained

### Negative
- Drawbacks accepted

### Neutral
- Things that change but aren't necessarily better or worse
```

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Summary |

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template above
2. Name it `XXX-short-description.md` where XXX is the next number
3. Fill in all sections
4. Update this README with the new ADR
5. Submit PR for review

## Reviewing ADRs

When reviewing an ADR, consider:
- Is the context clearly explained?
- Are alternatives considered?
- Are the consequences realistic?
- Is the decision actionable?
- Does it align with project goals?

## Changing Decisions

If a decision needs to be reversed or modified:
1. Don't edit the original ADR
2. Create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
3. Update the status of the old ADR to "Superseded by ADR-XXX"
4. Link from the old ADR to the new one
