# Orbit Jump - Development TODO

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### Zoom Controls Fixed ✅
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-31

**Issue**: Scroll wheel zoom and keyboard zoom controls (+ - 0 keys) were not functioning in the game.

**Root Cause Identified**:
The camera system was properly initialized and input events were being captured correctly, but the camera's `follow()` method (which contains the smooth zoom interpolation logic) was never being called during game updates.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated SystemOrchestrator's camera system to call `_G.GameCamera:follow(GameState.player, dt)` during updates
- This enables the smooth zoom interpolation code in camera.lua lines 100-105 to execute properly
- Input events were working all along - the issue was the missing update call

**Technical Details**:
- Input chain was working: `love.wheelmoved` → `Game.handleWheelMoved` → `camera:handleWheelMoved` ✅
- `targetScale` was being updated correctly ✅  
- Camera scale interpolation was not running due to missing `follow()` call ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Result**: 
Both scroll wheel and keyboard zoom controls (+ - 0 keys) now work perfectly with smooth interpolation.

## 🔧 SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

### UI Layout Testing System
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Date**: 2025-07-31

- ✅ Organized test files into proper `/tests/ui/` directory structure
- ✅ Created comprehensive UI testing framework with performance monitoring
- ✅ Enhanced debug system with F12 toggle, multiple themes, real-time validation
- ✅ CI/CD integration with bash script and JSON output
- ✅5/6 tests passing (1 accessibility issue remaining)

### World Generation & Rendering
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Date**: 2025-07-31

- ✅ Fixed missing planet generation during game initialization  
- ✅ Added world generator to SystemOrchestrator with proper initialization order
- ✅ Improved planet visibility (starting planet + nearby planets discovered by default)
- ✅ Enhanced undiscovered planet rendering (70% brightness instead of 50%)
- ✅ World now generates 6 planets successfully

## 🎮 GAMEPLAY FEATURES

### Camera System
**Status**: Complete ✅

**Completed**:
- ✅ Smooth camera following with look-ahead
- ✅ Camera shake effects
- ✅ Zoom system with smooth interpolation
- ✅ Zoom limits (0.3x to 3.0x) 
- ✅ Multiple input methods (scroll wheel + keyboard)
- ✅ Zoom controls fully functional with SystemOrchestrator integration

**Planned Features**:
- 🔲 Mouse zoom (hold key + drag)
- 🔲 Touch zoom for mobile devices
- 🔲 Zoom presets (1x, 2x, fit-to-screen)

### Player Analytics & Adaptation
**Status**: Working ✅

- ✅ Fixed `skillLevel` nil error in player movement system
- ✅ Enhanced adaptive physics based on player behavior
- ✅ Emotional feedback system integrated

## 🧪 TESTING & QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Current Test Results
**UI Layout Tests**: 5/6 passing (80%)
- ✅ Element positioning validation
- ✅ Performance benchmarks  
- ✅ Memory usage validation
- ✅ Edge case handling
- ⚠️ Responsive layout warnings (some layouts too similar)
- ❌ Accessibility compliance (touch targets too small on mobile)

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Enhanced test runner with multiple output formats
- ✅ Performance baseline tracking
- ✅ Regression testing framework
- ✅ CI/CD integration scripts

## 📱 MOBILE & ACCESSIBILITY

### Accessibility Issues
**Status**: Needs Attention ⚠️

- ❌ Touch targets too small on mobile (iPhone/progressionBar: 370x30, needs 44x44 minimum)
- ⚠️ Some UI elements may be too close together
- 🔲 Color contrast validation needed
- 🔲 Screen reader compatibility

### Mobile Optimization
- ✅ Mobile input detection
- ✅ Touch controls system
- ✅ Responsive UI scaling
- 🔲 Touch gesture support for zoom
- 🔲 Mobile-specific performance optimizations

## 🚀 PERFORMANCE

### Current Status
- ✅ Zero-allocation star field rendering
- ✅ Object pooling for particles
- ✅ Performance monitoring system
- ✅ Frame culling for off-screen objects
- ✅ Memory usage tracking

### Optimization Opportunities
- 🔲 Texture atlasing for sprites
- 🔲 LOD (Level of Detail) system for distant objects
- 🔲 Audio streaming optimization
- 🔲 Save system optimization

## 🎨 UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

### Debug & Developer Tools
**Status**: Excellent ✅

- ✅ Advanced UI debug visualization (F12 toggle)
- ✅ Real-time performance metrics
- ✅ Layout validation with color-coded issues
- ✅ Multiple debug themes
- ✅ Screenshot capture for debugging
- ✅ Comprehensive logging system

### Game UI
- ✅ Responsive layout system
- ✅ Multiple screen support (desktop/mobile)
- ⚠️ Some responsive layouts need improvement
- 🔲 Settings menu enhancements
- 🔲 Achievement system UI
- 🔲 Tutorial system improvements

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Code Organization
- ✅ Modular system architecture with SystemOrchestrator
- ✅ Proper error handling and graceful degradation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Test coverage for critical systems

### Build & Deployment
- ✅ CI/CD test runner scripts
- ✅ Multiple test environments
- 🔲 Automated build pipeline
- 🔲 Release management system

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES

1. **URGENT**: Fix zoom controls (scroll wheel & keyboard not working)
2. **HIGH**: Mobile accessibility compliance (touch target sizes)
3. **MEDIUM**: Responsive layout improvements
4. **LOW**: Performance optimizations

## 📞 DEBUG COMMANDS

When running the game with debug logging:
- **F12**: Toggle UI debug visualization
- **F11**: Validate current layout
- **F10**: Cycle debug levels
- **F9**: Switch debug themes
- **F8**: Take screenshot
- **+ or =**: Zoom in (should work, needs debugging)
- **-**: Zoom out (should work, needs debugging)  
- **0**: Reset zoom (should work, needs debugging)

## 📝 NOTES

- Game initialization logs show "World generated successfully with 6 planets"
- Camera system logs show "Camera system initialized: 800x600"
- All core systems are operational via SystemOrchestrator
- UI debug system is fully functional and robust
- Need to trace input event flow to identify zoom control issue
